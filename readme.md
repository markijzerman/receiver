# RECEIVER

#### A companion receiver mod for Norns broadcasts on https://broadcast.norns.online/
#### infinitedigits original broadcast mod: https://llllllll.co/t/broadcast/51592

## How it works
When this mod is installed, plus MPV player (see instructions here https://llllllll.co/t/norns-ideas/17625/1342), it will look for MP3s up on broadcast.norns.online and will list them in the PARAMS menu when a script is loaded.
There you can select a stream, either live or archived.
WARNING! You can not run this mod and the broadcast mod at the same time. They can both be 'installed', though you can not receive and broadcast at the same time.
